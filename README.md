TechDegree-Project-7

This Project uses the very popular React library to create an image gallery app.

JSX is used to write markup-like syntax directinly in the JS files and state is managed in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components.

The app was built using the Create React App and React Router modules.

1. JavaScript and JSX were used to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.

2. React Router was used to set up routes.

3. Axios is used to fetch data from the Flickr API and display images.

4. Logic was added to handle the search and various requirements of the project.

5. The CSS was personalized to include box shadows, text shadows, and background color.

"npm start" launches the server from the terminal.
